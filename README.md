## What is Framer Motion?

Think of Framer Motion as more of an improvement or reinvention of an existing animation library than a brand new one.

Framer Motion is the successor to Pose, which was one of the most popular animation libraries used with React. Like Pose, it’s built upon promotion, which is a low-level, unopinionated animation library, but it provides abstractions to streamline the process.

Framer Motion improves upon and simplifies the API in a way that couldn’t have been done without breaking changes and rewriting. One difference is that whereas Framer Motion only has support for React, Pose has support for React-Native and Vue. If you’re currently using Pose I would recommend updating to Framer Motion because Pose has been depreciated.
